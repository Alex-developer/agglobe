Xearth for Windows Source Code
------------------------------
January 28, 1998

This is the Xearth for Windows source code. It was compiled with 
Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0. 

The code currently compiles with a number of warnings, but none
of these warnings are fatal.

Please let me know if you add anything cool to Xearth. Happy hacking!
