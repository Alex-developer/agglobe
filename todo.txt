Things to do in Xearth for Windows.

- "What's this?" style help
- Degrees/minutes/seconds to decimal degrees converter
- Indicator that updating is happening (perhaps change taskbar icon)
- Quaketips - hover the mouse over a quake and pop up a window giving details
- Save raw quake finger info in registry for later viewing
- Check gamma operation
- Make sure background image is enabled

If you do any of these things, or anything else that improves Xearth, please
let me know so I can merge the changes into the main Xearth for Windows 
source.
